"""Run the toolkit's own sharpness gate on the delivered film instead of the review cut.

sharpness_check.py takes only a reel folder and picks the review cut (mp4/<slug>-slate.mp4) itself. This loads
the same module unchanged and points its master lookup at exports/dryrun-pitch.mp4; the measurement, threshold
and report format are the toolkit's own.
