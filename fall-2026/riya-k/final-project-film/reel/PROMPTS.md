# Prompts

No generation prompts: no image, video or voice-cloning model was used. Every scene is native
vector code in `scenes.py`; narration is local Kokoro TTS (`af_bella`, American female voice,
synthetic), $0.00. Captions are timed with local faster-whisper (`base.en`) word timestamps and
show the script text (`beat_sheet.json`), not the transcript. The instructions given to Claude
Code for the redo (the instructor's feedback plus Riya's requests: show the problem, real
examples, better animation, plain language, where it will be used, a proper conclusion,
female voice, name and title on the first screen, captions) are recorded in the submission's
BUILD-PROMPT.md.
